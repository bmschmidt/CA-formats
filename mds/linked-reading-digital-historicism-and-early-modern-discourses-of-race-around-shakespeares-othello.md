As Renaissance conceptions of otherness have become a locus of critical
study, no work has been more central for making the case about dominant
ideologies of race than Shakespeare's *Othello.*[^1]* *Ania Loomba has
suggested that \"more than any other play of the time, *Othello* allows
us to see that skin colour, religion, and location were often
contradictorily yoked together within ideologies of 'race,' and that all
these attributes were animated by notions of sexual and gender
difference.\"[^2] While some critics would moderate that
view[---]{.emdash}pointing more or less toward religion, or gender, or
geography[---]{.emdash}few would disagree about the basic ideology of
race that Loomba identifies in the play and the early modern period.
Daniel J. Vitkus, for example, focuses more on religious conversion than
race, but still argues that "cultural anxieties about 'turning Turk'"
were part of "the fear of a black planet that gripped Europeans in the
early modern era as they faced the expansion of Ottoman power."[^3] Many
others have agreed that the play "repeats and reinforces the already
established perception of Turks as the 'religious threat' and racial
'other.'"[^4] A few, like Eric Griffin, have brought the focus on
religion closer to home, reading the play as an expression of English
nationalism during a time of tension with Catholic Spain, when
anti-Catholic, anti-Spanish expression was its own form of othering
"ethnocentric discourse."[^5] But even this broadened critical
discussion is based on examination of a limited number of the texts
published in early modern England, and it tells only a small part of the
story of race in *Othello.*[^6] Digital approaches, however, open up a
vast new body of texts for analysis, shifting the ground on which such
criticism can take place.[^7]

Our work builds from the work of postcolonial scholars, such as Sujata
Iyengar, Mary Floyd-Wilson, Emily Bartels, and Jyotsna Singh, who have
recently turned back the clock on England's history of empire by
usefully drawing attention to representations of racial and cultural
otherness in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Our
research attempts to recuperate an unfamiliar definition of pre-modern
race by taking seriously Loomba's proposal that "vocabularies of race"
in Shakespeare's time were composed of a "historical, geographical, and
social layering of racial ideas and languages." To peel back these
"layers" of discourse, critics such as Richmond Barbour (2003), Su Fang
Ng (2006), and Robert Markley (2006) have examined early modern
England's interaction with geographical regions such as East Asia and
the Near East, and Ng specifically calls for a turn to a "global
Renaissance," moving beyond the scope of the New World and the
Mediterranean world so as to reanimate lost, ignored, or unfamiliar
"vocabularies of race" that may come to challenge our postcolonial
preconceptions.

Using digital techniques to expand our textual frame of reference to
include tens of thousands of Renaissance books in many ways affirms the
claims of Shakespeareans interested in adding new layers to England's
worldview, but does so by shifting our frame of reference beyond the
narrow confines of the canon. Our method establishes textual scale as a
structuring principle of geographical, spatial scale in studying the
pre-modern world: the more texts we consider, the broader and more
complex England's worldview appears. By testing their insights at a
large scale, our analyses confirm the readings of previous
Shakespeareans but in a surprising way. Our results suggest that
geographical, ecological, and humoral reading strategies, which
currently represent a fairly small niche of Shakespearean criticism, are
equally as important in defining the early modern discourse of race as
the widely-accepted readings that understand plays like *Othello*
through the lens of skin color or religion. We suggest that these
results introduce alternative definitions of early modern race in which
geographical and spatial variables were at least as important as more
readily recognizable factors such as skin color and anatomy in
determining conceptions of race in Shakespeare's time.

How do we assess the meaning of race when our field of vision is not
merely a handful of canonical plays, scholastic treatises, and travel
narratives, but tens of thousands of sermons, geographical atlases,
navigational treatises, mathematical handbooks, broadsides, romances,
royal proclamations, and systematic theologies? Our approach has been to
combine digital techniques in a methodology we call 'Linked Reading'
that embeds topic models and vector space models within historical book
networks, allowing us to explore both the language associated with race
in texts that mention Moors and the extensive networks of booksellers,
printers, and publishers who produced these texts. For *Othello*'s
earliest audiences and readers, as we will show, discussions of "race"
could range across multiple topics and be motivated by a variety of
interests[---]{.emdash}trade, geography, militarization, the body, sex,
religion, globalism, the passions. Our results suggest that the
pre-modern idea of race was structured by a logic of place as much as by
logics of skin color. Across the wide range of texts about race and
ethnicity in Shakespeare's England, a dominant thread was that
geography, and not necessarily skin color or the body, was a key factor
in shaping how space, landscape, latitude, climate, and a location's
flora and fauna defined a culture, its people, and their bodies. In its
initial printing and subsequent century of republication and reception,
we will argue, *Othello* yoked these threads together in a way that was
more unusual than existing criticism would suggest. Indeed, if
Shakespeare scholars have largely read *Othello* as a representative
text on early modern race, our analysis suggests instead that the text
was atypical in its mobilization of a racial vocabulary. We hope to use
this work to tell a very different story about the multiple discourses
of race that helped motivate *Othello*'s earliest publications and that
the play itself only later came to define.

For this inquiry we turned to two discrete digital humanities projects,
\"[Global
Renaissance](http://renaissance-nlp.net:8400/projects/eebo2)" and
"[Shakeosphere](https://shakeosphere.lib.uiowa.edu)\". The projects use
different but related datasets, and integrating them to investigate a
single research question gives us a powerful new perspective on the
texts contained in each. Global Renaissance uses the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec algorithms to mine the 25,363 text corpus
of Early English Books Online (EEBO) / Text Creation Partnership (TCP)
for terms and concepts that have a high likelihood of occurring
together.[^8] Shakeosphere, by contrast, draws on the bibliographic
records in the English Short Title Catalogue (ESTC) of nearly half a
million works published in England, Scotland, Ireland, and the Americas,
before 1800 and uses quantitative network analysis to study the
connections between people, places, and books. To put it simply, Global
Renaissance studies the topics composing the early modern textual
discourse, while Shakeosphere studies the people responsible for
creating and selling those texts. To examine the networks of meaning in
*Othello*, we built a new system that would link the projects and allow
investigators to pivot between the two approaches and datasets. Starting
with all the topics from works that mention "Moors" in Global
Renaissance, for example, we can zero in on a particular publication in
the topic, like *Othello*, and then pivot to Shakeosphere to see the
network of other books and people closely associated with that work.
Conversely, we can start with a significant publication network in
Shakeosphere[---]{.emdash}a group of publishers, printers, and
booksellers who have published a text of interest to us[---]{.emdash}and
then pivot to Global Renaissance for analysis of the most prominent
topics in works produced by this network.[^9] Any given text yields
dozens of topics, and any given topic is constituted by a network of
hundreds of texts, authors, publishers, and booksellers.

The linked system we have built does not generate answers to questions
like "what did the phrase 'valiant Moor' really mean to Shakespeare and
his contemporaries?" But it allows us to approach such questions from
multiple perspectives and constantly shifting angles of vision, while
leveraging the distinct strengths of each dataset and connecting them in
ways that minimize their limitations.[^10] As Ian Gadd has noted for
example, EEBO is a "remarkable scholarly tool" [^11] when used properly,
but it can offer the "illusion of comprehensiveness" to users who do not
realize what it has left out.[^12] Namely, for the period 1473-1700,
EEBO does not include 27% of the items listed in the ESTC (in either
full text of facsimile), and although EEBO draws on ESTC metadata to
construct its own records, it has heavily edited that data, removing
information about collations, Stationer's Register entrances, while
creating no "formal mechanism for synchronising data between the two
sources."[^13] Our system not only offers this mechanism, but leverages
it as an analytical tool that allows us to move from the thematic
connotations of a specific Shakespearean usage, to the broader topical
trends in writing about Moors, to the print networks that brought those
texts into being, and back again. Taken together, these methods can help
us understand not only what *Othello*'s construction of race may have
meant during the time of its initial 1604 performance, but also why race
suddenly became a hot commodity in Quarto and Folio nearly twenty years
later, and how the racial logic between those publications may have
differed.

 

**Linked Reading in *Othello*** {#linked-reading-in-othello style="text-align: center;"}
-------------------------------

At every stage, the process of Linked Reading involved interpretive
*work,* as the researchers puzzled over results, debated them, read,
recalibrated tools, puzzled over the relationship between our findings
and the existing scholarly and primary literature, debated some more,
and finally agreed on an argument that we think can make sense of it
all. We began by running LDA and word2vec on all documents in the 25,363
text Early English Books Online (EEBO) / Text Creation Partnership Phase
I corpus, and specifically on the 14,708 paragraphs (from 3,147 texts)
in the EEBO corpus mentioning all variants of the word "Moor," including
Shakespeare's plays and editions of *Othello.*

LDA, as David Blei has defined it, "topic models find the sets of terms
that tend to recur together in the texts."[^14] Performed well, topic
modeling "is good at revealing quiet changes"[^15] across historical
periods writ large, which might not be registered in a reading of
canonical texts alone. In this sense, Underwood and Goldstone suggest
that "topics may even indicate a discourse in Foucault's sense" and
topic modeling may be a step toward a more complete discursive
methodology.[^16] We have refined the LDA algorithm to increase its
historical sensitivity in three ways. First, we created a search index
that reversed the "bag of words" pre-processing step by resituating the
words in a topic model back in their local textual context of the
paragraph. Second, we divided our corpus by two document scales - the
full text and the paragraph - in contrast to the conventional assignment
of a document with an entire book. Our third refinement was to cluster
groups of topics with similar words across many replicates of our LDA
tests using cosine similarity to compare particularly stable topics that
recur over independent runs.[^17] We paired our LDA topic models with
word embeddings, using word2vec, to provide a second way to study word
relationships in our Moor corpus.[^18] Word embeddings are most suited
for word-level semantic analysis, whereas topic modeling is more suited
to document-level word relationships.[^19] We paired these two
approaches as a way to compare word-level and document-level networks of
meaning.[^20]

To pinpoint the broader debates that were circulating when *Othello* was
written, first performed, and first published, we divided the EEBO
corpus into subsets of pre-performance (1473-1604) and pre-publication
(1473-1622 and 1473-1623) texts that mention "Moor," as well as
post-publication texts (1623-1700). Slicing the corpus in this way
allowed us to identify the topics and word vectors for the period up to
and including the probable first performance in 1604, the publication of
the 1622 quarto (Q) edition of *Othello,* the 1623 folio (F) edition,
and these texts' afterlife until the end of the seventeenth century. The
results of our tests were visualized in the following vector space
(Figure 1), with topics clustered in a two-dimensional PCA projection in
the middle, the term-topic list on the right pane, and the document
retrieval interface for the topic on the left pane. When we wanted to
compare the term lists across different topics, we employed the
term-topic matrix visualization (Figure 2) to align multiple topics at
once.

Figure 2. Term-Topic Matrix and Document Retrieval Interface.
:::

We structured our tests in this manner to evaluate Leah Marcus'
suggestion that the Q and F versions of Shakespeare's play "mean
differently," especially in the Folio's much more explicit and
pernicious construction of racial difference as an indelible bodily
trait.[^21] Only in the folio, for example, does Roderigo describe
Desdemona "in the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor," and only in the
folio does Othello describe Desdemona's name as "black / As mine own
face" (3.3.384-5). Whether Shakespeare added the passages later or they
were cut for an earlier performance before making their way back into
Quarto publication, the Folio insistently calls attention to "Noses,
ears, and lips" (4.1.39) and other bodily markers of racial identity in
a way that the earlier Quarto text did not. As we shall see, the 1622
Quarto and 1623 Folio editions are associated with different groups of
topics, and this is an important part of the story we have to tell.

Our LDA models from EEBO texts preceding the printing of *Othello*
produced a range of topics, including some that conform to a standard
story of race, sexuality, and religion in the early modern world. These
"conforming" topics do not necessarily reveal new racial paradigms, but
they do suggest that our method can consistently reproduce the findings
of previous scholars and is at least not wildly off the mark. Figure
three, for example, shows that a range of topics emerge in the multiple
temporal tiers of the "Moor" discourse before the printing of *Othello*
in 1622. The figure presents the term-topic matrix that represents two
topics from runs of the LDA algorithm performed upon all of the texts
before 1604 and 1622, respectively. The terms listed in the selected
topics are the words that have a high probability of co-occurring in the
"Moor" texts; the radius of the node represents the probability of the
word occurring in the topic; and the order of the word in the list shows
its relative frequency in the documents, with high frequency words
listed toward the top of the list. In these topics, the most probable
word "love" occurs together in paragraphs with "death," "passion,"
"wife," "torture," "faith," and "daughter," a vocabulary that conflates
romance, sexuality, and pain.

Figure 3. Sexuality and Romance topics, pre-1604 (left) / 1622 (right).
:::

Using our search index to identify and retrieve the EEBO documents
associated with these topics, we find that they draw on texts including
Christopher Marlowe's *Tamburlaine* (1590)*,* John Pory's popular
translation of Leo Africanus's *Geographical Historie of Africa*
(1600)*,* and John Robert's chivalric romance, *Honor's Conquest*
(1598). Shakespeare's *Merchant of Venice* (1600) also earns a place in
these topics, thanks to the Prince of Morocco's wooing of Portia and the
following exchange between Lorenzo and Lancelot:

> [Jessica: ....he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for
> in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of
> pork.]{style="line-height: 1.4em;"}
>
> Lorenzo: I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can
> the getting up of the Negro's belly. The Moor is with child by you,
> Lancelot.
>
> Lancelot: It is much that the Moor should be more than reason, but if
> she be an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
> (III.v.31-37)

This strong association of words signifying gender, sexuality, and race
co-mingling within topics illuminates the "historical dependency between
patriarchalism and racism" that Loomba describes in *Gender, Race, and
Renaissance Drama,* where the staging of racial and sexual difference in
*Othello* and other plays serves to construct colonial authority.[^22]
Griffin has argued that early modern European anxieties over racial
miscegenation are already prevalent in the period, especially in such
contexts as the Spanish emphasis on "purity of blood."[^23]

We may also see anxieties about racial miscegenation reflected more
broadly in topics like figure four's "family / slave / monster" topic
(labeled as "Topic 15"), which is drawn from works published before
1622.

::: {#attachment_1160 .image style="max-width: 291px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig4.png)

Figure 4. Family / Slave / Monster Topic, Pre-1622.
:::

This topic includes works such as *The Most Famous History of the Seven
Champions of Christendom,* by Richard Johnson (1596), Edward Topsell's
*History of Four Footed Beasts* (1607), Robert Car's 1600 translation of
*The Mahumetane or Turkish Historie,* and a few "literary" romances,
including *Orlando Furioso* (translated 1591) and Claude Colet's
*Famous, Pleasant, and Variable History of Palladine of England,* which
was translated and published in English in 1588. The upshot of the topic
is that such texts are highly likely to include words like "harlot,"
"lewd," "slave," "Roderigo," and "monster" in close proximity to the
word "Moor."

The topics that precede *Othello's* printing across all time thresholds
also confirm that religion stands as an abiding concern in English
thinking about Moors, as studies by Griffen, Vitkus, and others have
argued. Figure five, for example, shows representative "religion" topics
from the pre-1604 and pre-1622 subsets. In both years, the "religion"
topic reveals intermingled discussions of "Turk," "Christian," "Moor,"
"Jew," "Arabian," "Persian," and "Religion," although the pre-1604 topic
draws almost exclusively on sermons, religious publications, and natural
histories, while the pre-1622 topic includes many "literary" texts,
including John Webster's *The White Devil* (1612)*,* John Harrington's
translation of *Orlando Furioso* (1591)*,* Christopher Marlowe's
*Tamburlaine* (1590)*,* and Thomas Kyd's *The Tragedy of Soloman and
Perseda* (1592)*.*

right).
:::

Terms such as "Italian," "Turke," "Mediterraneum," and even "Indian"
suggest a broad but familiar cultural geography, even as the appearance
of "Angola" in the latter "religion" topic may suggest the tendency to
push confessional loyalties and tensions into an expanding global
theatre.

Lest we be tempted to read these results as merely confirming what
scholars already knew, however, it is worth noting a result that came as
a distinct surprise: such topics are a clear minority of the ones
generated by our LDA analysis. In the pre-1622 corpus (everything up to,
but not including, *Othello*), we find eleven topics on geography and
navigation and four topics on trade and resources, in addition to the
five topics on sex/the body/romance, eleven topics on religion, five on
political organization, and five on military affairs (figure six).

::: {#attachment_1162 .image style="max-width: 650px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig6.png)

Figure 6. Summary of Topics, Pre-1622 EEBO Corpus.
:::

We define "geographical" topics as ones where the words that have the
highest probability of occurring together include place names (Egypt,
Ethiopia, Poland, etc), topographical terms (island, desert, cape, etc),
and technical navigational language (anchor, boat, sail, etc). Topics on
trade and resources are defined by materials like "tree," "rice,"
"grain," and "wheat." The topics shift a bit by decade, but across all
our LDA runs, geography, trade, and material resources always represent
the most common themes, with geography especially outstripping any other
cluster in prominence. In other words, it seems clear that geography,
trade, and location-specific topics, as much as skin color, sexuality,
or religion, shaped the perception of Moorish identity and the likely
reception of *Othello.* Indeed, if a play about Moors evoked "hot
button" issues in the England of 1604 when *Othello* was probably first
performed, these topic models imply that trade and geography would have
rivaled religion and bodily difference as the most characteristic
linguistic markers of those plays.

Indeed, when we turn to the LDA topics that include the first two
editions of *Othello* (figure seven), we surprisingly find that the
play, in quarto and folio, occurs almost exclusively in "geographical"
topics, rather than in topics on sexuality, the passions, or the body.
In fact, 85.7% of topics that include at least one version of the play
are geographical, global, or naval in nature.

Figure 7. LDA Topics that include Othello, Pre-1623.
:::

Othello is a captain, he sets sail for Cyprus, and, according to the LDA
algorithm's probabilistic modeling, the play's language has the highest
likelihood of sharing common language with technical texts on
navigation, global space, discovery, and trade. Indeed, here *Othello*
begins to look like a true outlier, since at the document level,
*Othello*'s plaiting together of geographical, naval, and militaristic
language aligns it more closely with technical texts, travel guides,
news sheets, and corantos than with contemporary plays, literary
romances, or the kinds of cultural ethnographies sometimes offered up in
sermons and polemical tracts. Figure eight shows LDA topics on geography
and landscape that find a shared vocabulary linking Shakespeare's
*Othello* and Samuel Purchas' famous text on global travel, *Purchas his
Pilgrimes* (1613), alongside texts on "cosmographie," surveying, and
chorography.

Figure 8. LDA Topics that include Othello.
:::

Even more unexpectedly, the converse also holds true: the early
publications of *Othello* are not part of the cluster of dramatic and
literary texts, like *Lust's Dominion* (1600) and even Shakespeare's
earlier play *Titus Andronicus* (1594), which contribute to topics on
the passions, female sexuality, and religion (figure nine).

Figure 9. "Moor" Topic Composed of Literary Texts.
:::

To verify the findings of our LDA tests, our word2vec analysis shown
below shows word-level semantic relationships without taking documents
into account. We used cosine similarity to measure the distance between
word vectors, and then principal component analysis (PCA) to flatten the
high dimensional space into a three-dimensional projection. Word nodes
that are closer in the vector space have a higher probability of
occurring in the same semantic context, while more distant words have a
lower probability of occurring together. Based on this word-level
analysis (figure ten), we can see that the discourse of "Moores" in the
EEBO corpus from 1500 through 1623 exhibits precisely the same naval,
mercantile, and geographically diverse vocabulary, including words such
as "ships," "seas," "trade," "fleete," "marchants," "traffique,"
"indias," and "marchandize", as we have seen in the document-level
analysis of the LDA topics containing *Othello* alongside texts on
global travel and shipping.

Figure 10. Word2Vec Model of "Moores" (EEBO Corpus, 1500-1623).
:::

Based on the LDA models' alignment of *Othello* with a navigational
discourse, and the word2vec models' identification of the keyword "Moor"
with the same naval and trade vocabulary, our results suggest that at
the time of its initial publication *Othello* participated in the early
"Moor" discourse on a geographical, navigational, and naval register
that was at least as coherent as the terrain of politics, religion, or
the body.

Even without their strong association with *Othello,* these
"geographical" or "global" topics would seem to be significant to
understanding the play, because they are surprisingly stable
[---]{.emdash}  across all time thresholds, and within multiple
replicates of the LDA tests, the same clusters of words appear, defining
geography and space in proximity to passages that mention Moors. These
geographical topics reveal that the very notion of "geography" in the
period is complicated, with two distinct models of England's worldview
coming into focus, one marked by European places, and the other by
global spaces.

First, a strong trend defines a proximate vision of European *place*
that maps neatly onto the political and religious fault lines of a
familiar continental Renaissance. Geographical contexts used to define
Moors in the topics shown in figure eleven, from LDA runs performed on
pre-1604 and pre-1623 EEBO texts, include "Spain," "Portugal,"
"Granada," "French," and "England," along with the more distant
"Affrica" and "Turk."

Less familiar is a second tier of geographical topics characterized by
an "equinoctial" imagination of Moors that is markedly more technical
than the cultural conflicts described by the first tranche of European
topics. Here we find clusters of words related to space and climate.

Figure 12. Complexion/Equinoctial/Global Geography Topics, Pre-1604
(left) / 1622 (center) / 1623 (right).
:::

The recurring and most peculiar word in this series of topics across
date ranges is "equinoctial," which suggests "a state of equal day and
night" (as in the annual vernal equinox) but was used in the Renaissance
as a *spatial* and not calendrical category. Heavily discussed in
debates about the "equinoctial circle," or as Milton puts it in Book 10
of *Paradise Lost*, the "Equinoctial Rode" (672) served as a stable
spatial reference point marking the celestial or terrestrial equator.
The equator was termed "equinoctial" intuitively because, according to
the Oxford English Dictionary, when the sun shines upon it, "nights and
days are of equal length in all parts of the world."[^24] The
cartographical logic of the "equinoctial" line organizing the
Renaissance imagination of global space also structures the words that
recur in these technical geography topics, including "pole," "earth,"
"line," "zone," "sea," "ocean," "land," and the compass directions of
north, south, east, and west. Far from being a purely abstract
cartographical calculation, however, these topics refer to a range of
concrete place names to anchor the representation of the globe:
"Africa," Asia,\" "Ethiopian," "Canton," "China," "Italian," "India,"
"Portugal," "Benin," "Peru," Malabar,\" "Persia," "Albania," "America,"
and "Florida" are all specific locations populating this grid of global
space. What's significant here is that the cartographical discourse of
equinoctial lines, poles, and zones explodes outwards from the narrow
confines of the local European topics on the "Moor."

A word2vec evaluation of the semantic range of "equinoctial" in the EEBO
corpus from 1500 to 1623 demonstrates an analogous geographical
vocabulary of spatial markers and a diversity of global place names, as
seen in figure thirteen.

Figure 13. Word2Vec Model of "Equinoctial" (EEBO Corpus from 1500-1623).
:::

The terms of these global topics also differ substantially, shifting
from a historical register of European political and cultural conflict
to the more technical vocabulary of how space can be theorized and
organized in a mathematical way. Climate (rather than ethno-religious
conflict) binds the disparate geographies of the "equinoctial" topics
together. The repetition of the words "clime," "zone," "heat," "cold"
and "torrida" describes a logic of climatological zones and bands as the
tissue binding the wide range of otherwise unrelated regions in the New
World, Europe, Africa, and Asia into a cohesive spatial amalgam. We see
this reasoning in familiar texts such as Thomas Hariot's *Briefe and
True Report*, which claims that Virginia is a worthy place to explore
and populate, since it shares the \"nature of the climate, being
answerable to the Iland of *Japan*, the land of *China, Persia, Jury*,
the Ilandes of *Cyprus* and *Candy*, the South parts of *Greece, Italy*,
and *Spaine*, and of many other notable and famous countreis.\"[^25] For
Hariot, the range of agricultural commodities capable of being grown in
Virginia could be inferred from the shared latitude, and therefore
climates, of global regions, with "suger canes" likely to be successful,
"seeing that they grow in the same climate, in the South part of Spaine
and in Barbary."[^26] Silk also was a promising cash crop since it
"groweth in Persia, which is in the selfe same climate as Virginia, of
which very many of the silke workes that come from thence into Europe
are made. Here of if it be planted and ordered as in Persia" and "will
rise as great profite in time to the Virginians, as there of doth now to
the Persians, Turkes, Italians and Spaniards."[^27] The topics reflect
Hariot's understanding of a globe structured by latitude, where regions
halfway around the world and their practices could be bound together in
a single breath based on climate rather than proximity, shared culture,
or radical otherness. The underlying logic of these geographical topics
is not "race" understood as a function of the body's physiology, and
taken as a whole the language of skin color and anatomical difference
exists faintly.[^28]

The "equinoctial" definition of space in England's nascent globalism is
not limited to the promise of a region's flora; "complexion" and
"temper" also appear as dominant terms in this range of geographical
topics.  Mary Floyd-Wilson's work on "geohumoralism" and ethnicity in
the Renaissance gives us a useful means to understand the link between
geography, complexion, and temper, specifically as these terms relate to
the depiction of Moors in early English texts.[^29] Floyd-Wilson
describes an early modern system of "regionally framed humoralism" that
constituted an early modern "scientific ethnology." [^30] According to
this early modern humoural science, the "environment...necessarily
produced" peoples "of all climates," and Floyd-Wilson suggests this made
the body and its humoral system the basis of a "somatic" framework that
gave coherence to the geographical organization of the world.[^31] Our
topic models provide broad evidence for such a "geohumoralist" reading,
but in a far more radical way than even Floyd-Wilson's exegeses would
suggest. In our topics, the "complexions" and "tempers" associated with
a given climate or location move beyond the plane of the body,
physiology, ethnicity, and skin color. Embedded in a network of
cartographical concepts, "complexion" and "temper" serve as geographical
terms in the Renaissance mind, and thus the "equinoctial" imagination
helped define the idea of race as a spatially inflected formation.

In the Renaissance mind, then, the "equinoctial" imagination helped
define the idea of race in a fundamentally spatial way because
"complexion" and "temper" were shaped by the geography of a specific
place. Using word2vec in figure fourteen to examine EEBO from 1500 to
1623 at the word level demonstrates that "complexion" defines a
phenotype modulated by "physicke," "constitution," "melancholy,"
"tempers," and the "temperature" of the local environment, far more than
an immutable genotype. Indeed, the "blacke\_moore" pairs with
"behavior," rather than words associated with the body or skin color.

:::

Turning back to *Othello*, we see this spatialized sense of "complexion"
clearly when Iago casts Desdemona's desire for the Moorish general as a
deviation from "her own clime, complexion, and degree, / Whereto we see
in all things nature tends" (III.iii.235-6). And indeed, a word
embedding of "complexion" after the publication of the play (figure
fifteen) shows that Othello himself comes to contribute to the very
definition of the idea, in a closer relationship with "tempers,"
"appetites," and "affections," than the vocabulary of "blackness."

Figure 15. Word2Vec Model of "Complexion" (EEBO Corpus from 1623-1700).
:::

In the topics and word embeddings where it appears, "complexion"
gestures toward its Latin root *complectere,* indicating a pre-modern
idea of race as the plaiting or intertwining of many variables,
including landscape, latitude, climate, and local flora and fauna, in a
way that is made legible by the humoral body. See for example, figure
sixteen, below, where the proximity of "black," "Indian," "white,"
"complexion" might incline us to read this as a cluster of words about
the body:

::: {#attachment_1172 .image style="max-width: 492px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig16.png)

Figure 16. Complexion Topic, Pre-1622.
:::

Indeed, some of the texts composing this cluster seem, at first glance,
to exhibit the crudest kind of racial essentialism, as is the case in
Pietro Martire d'Anghiera's *The history of travayle in the West and
East Indies,* which argues that men differ in skin color not because of
differences in weather or temperature, but because "God hath so ordeyned
it."[^32] But ultimately this leads the author to understand racial
complexion as something as mysterious as the fabric of nature itself,
rather than immediately legible on the body. Racial difference offers
"further occasions to Philosophers to searche the seccretes of nature,
and complexions of men, with the novelties of the newe worlde."[^33]

Our algorithm associates *Othello* more strongly with this global
perspective than with more purely local concerns or racial verities. But
why does complexion in *Othello* look so different from most other
contemporary plays that include passages about Moors? Why does it, in
fact, look so different even from itself? Zooming in on the distinctions
between the Quarto and Folio by running LDA on the pre-1623 corpus, we
begin to see that all the aspects of *Othello* that set it apart from
other "Moor" plays are more pronounced in Quarto than in Folio. Although
both printings of the play occur together in many LDA runs, the Quarto
seems to be much more of its moment in this sense and less engaged with
the ethnographic discourse that comes to define "the Moor" generally and
Othello in particular across the long span of English literary history
represented by the entire EEBO corpus. When we step back and look at LDA
runs that represent the entire period of the EEBO corpus, the Folio
version of *Othello* is prominent in topics such as these:

::: {#attachment_1173 .image style="max-width: 650px"}

Figure 17. Othello in "Moor" Topics Across Entire EEBO Corpus,
1473-1700.
:::

These topics take us back to a fairly familiar understanding of race in
the play, in which difference is corporeal, demonized, and associated
with England's Catholic rivals. As we shall see later, this in fact
becomes the dominant way of seeing the play in its longer reception
history. But the Quarto has essentially disappeared from the discourse
defining Moors in this paradigm [---]{.emdash}  unlike the Folio
*Othello,* the LDA does not see the Quarto contributing to such topics
in any statistically significant way. To get a sense of the difference,
once again, between these topics and the ones where we *do* find the
Quarto, here is an example of an earlier topic that includes the first
printing:

::: {#attachment_1174 .image style="max-width: 302px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig18.png)

Figure 18. "Moor" Topic including Quarto Edition.
:::

This trade-oriented topic, with terms like "spice," "ship," "Holland,"
and "ware," couldn't be more different from the topics that include the
Folio. To understand the gap, we can pivot to the network of printers
and publishers that first brought *Othello* to London's bookstalls in
Quarto nearly twenty years after its first performance. Here, we can
begin to get a better idea of how the play's complex temper and its
particular global engagements may have helped make it a vendible
commodity in 1622, in ways that have become more difficult to see in the
following years.

 

**Othello's Publication Networks** {#othellos-publication-networks style="text-align: center;"}
----------------------------------

The Quarto *Othello* was printed in 1622 by Nicholas Okes and published
by Thomas Walkley. Scholars have shed a good deal of ink wondering how
they gained access to the play and whether it brings us closer or takes
us further from Shakespeare's intended text.[^34] Such questions may
ultimately be counterproductive, as Scott McMillan notes, since "all
successful Elizabethan plays existed in multiple scripts over their
lifetimes, and those that have come down to us in only one version are
untypical."[^35] But we do know that Walkley and Okes, working together
or with others, produced *Othello* and four other King's Men plays
between 1619 and 1622. By using Shakeosphere to explore the connections
between the people and texts related to these works, we can begin to get
a sense of their place in the publication networks that produced them.

First, it quickly becomes clear that literary and dramatic texts were
somewhat outside the norm for either the printer or publisher. On the
network map below, we have highlighted Okes, Walkley, and Shakespeare,
as well as the large node in the center, Bernard Alsop. The size of the
nodes correlates to the number of publications associated with them.
Alsop, for example, is one of the printers that Joad Raymond describes
as "having established advantageous economies of scale and operational
infrastructures" that allowed them to dominate the market and made them
instrumental in developing the English newspaper.[^36] In the network
below, the left-hand side is dominated by publications of news and
current events, while the right includes more literary and religious
texts. *Othello* sits astride these worlds.

::: {#attachment_1175 .image style="max-width: 650px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig19.png)

Figure 19. Print Network of Okes, Walkley, and Shakespeare.
:::

Walkley and Okes were jockeying for their own place in the vibrant
network that Alsop was coming to dominate alongside Nicholas Bourne (the
largest green node in the image above). In this quest Walkley clearly
had a star publication [---]{.emdash}  *A Catalogue of Nobility of
England, Scotland, and Ireland,* which he reprinted dozens of times.
This was not a hoary almanac, but a form of news for an audience
interested in state affairs. As Zachary Lesser suggests, "from his
location at Britain's Burse, Walkley was ideally positioned to offer
news of Westminster politics to this audience of 'Paul's walkers,'
courtiers, and Parliament men, and we should see the literature he
published not primarily as his contribution to English letters but as
part of this enduring specialty."[^37] According to Lesser, *Othello*
and Walkley's other plays thus "reveal that his customers' interest in
mixed government may have derived less from an idealistic desire to
transform Parliament into a constitutional institution than from a more
immediate and practical concern: England could wage war against Spain
only if James called a parliament."[^38]

Indeed, although many of them do not appear in the full text data we
used for our LDA runs, a cluster of Walkley publications in the more
expansive network analysis of ESTC metadata clearly share a bellicose
stance that would make them strong candidates for topics that associate
*Othello* with military matters. Works like John Everard's *Arriereban*
(1618) and Thomas Trussel's *The Souldier Pleading His Owne Case* (1619)
urge continental intervention that will make England a competitive
military power in a global theatre. "By armes," Trussel writes, "Germany
is defended from the power of the cruel Turkes...By Armes, the Spaniards
have got in their power the West Indes, and by Armes do they hold the
same in obedience to their scepter."[^39] Walkley also published the
picaresque novel *The Pursuit of the Historie of Lazarillo de Tormez*
(1622)*,* about a protagonist who sets out with missionary zeal on a
Spanish ship to \"open the eyes of *Mores,* blinded with errors; to
sinke and batter the bold and Pyraticall Navie; \[and\] to serue a
valiant Captaine.\"[^40] The original *Life of Lazarillo de Tormez*
(1554)*,* to which this publication was a sequel, has been called "a
propaganda gift to powers hostile to Spain."[^41] And Walkley seems to
have been so eager to cash in on the sensation it caused in 1622 that he
may have had a hand in the work's translation, coyly noting in the
dedication to Robert Stanley (an up-and coming member of the Lords) that
he has "strangely recovered" the work from obscurity.[^42] On the
network map above, *Lazarillo* is closely associated with a large
cluster of "news" publications\" that dominate the lower left-hand side.

If *Othello* was newsworthy in 1622, however, it was not only because
its militarism tapped into anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiment, as
we see from its strong topical association with far flung geographies
and with fellow protestant nations such as the Dutch. And significantly,
this is where the network of publications associated with *Othello*'s
printer are even more informative than those associated with its
publisher. Although we may not be accustomed to considering the
predilections and business calculations of printers when thinking about
the success of a given book, Peter M.N. Blayney notes that Okes would
have had significant agency in the publications he produced, since "a
small Jacobean printing house was not a clinically efficient
book-factory staffed by automata," and "any printer whose presses were
not starved of work have been to exercise his own preferences (both
personal and literary) when choosing between available offers of
work."[^43]

Although he is hardly a household name today, Okes was so well known as
a provider of timely and sometimes unreliable news about global trade
and travel that Ben Jonson inserted a gag about him in *News From the
New World Discovered in the Moon* (1620, p. 95). Okes is basically
invisible to traditional histories of the period, however. He lacks an
entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, and even Blayney
sounds apologetic about discussing the printer in his rigorous and
expansive two volume book history, where he notes that "Okes is of some
interest in the wider context of Jacobean play-printing and can, in
several ways, be considered usefully representative of the printers
responsible for many of the more important pre-restoration
quartos."[^44]

This however is where network analysis clearly allows us to observe
something that traditional scholarship has missed, because when we rank
all publishers and booksellers by their average number of connections
(their degree) between Shakespeare's birth in 1564 and the first Folio's
publication in 1623, we find that Okes is not really "representative" at
all. He is in fact the most connected person in the entire print network
during this time:

::: {#attachment_1176 .image style="max-width: 650px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig20.png)

Figure 20. Degree Rank (average connections) of Publishers and Printers,
1564-1623.
:::

In network analysis, "degree" measures the number of connections between
one individual and others; "betweenness" measures an individual's
centrality by calculating the number of other individuals who are
connected through their mutual relationships with that person. In both
measures, Nicholas Okes ranks higher than any other publisher, printer,
bookseller, or author between Shakespeare's birth in 1564 and the
publication of the first folio in 1623. What might it mean, in real
world terms, to have the highest "degree" of any other publisher or
printer during this period? Since Shakeosphere generates an "edge," or
connection, between a bookseller, printer, publisher, or author any time
they share space on the same title page or the ESTC bibliographical
metadata, a high degree means not only that a printer produces a great
number of titles, but also that those titles represent an unusual range
of different authors, that the printer works with a surprising variety
of publishers, and that his books can be found in multiple shops. The
ranking above makes it apparent that Okes is an exceptional figure, with
more than twice as many connections as the man ranked seventh on the
list, Edward Allde, who is today probably better known, thanks to his
penchant for printing plays, including the first, "bad quarto" of *Romeo
and Juliet* and others by Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, and Thomas
Dekker.

But Allde is still one of the top ten most connected figures in the
early modern print network, and to get a true sense of just *how*
exceptional Okes really was, it may help to consider a chart of "average
degree" across the entire print network during this time.

::: {#attachment_1177 .image style="max-width: 650px"}
![](http://culturalanalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lee_fig21.png)

Figure 21. Degree Distribution of Individuals in the English Print
Network, 1564-1623.
:::

The chart above shows the print network between 1564 and 1623 follows
typical power law behavior, and that the vast majority of individuals in
the network have fewer than ten connections. Okes is far out in the long
tail of anomalous "superconnectors" who form the hubs in the early
modern print network.

Rather than asking whether Okes is merely "of some interest in the wider
context of Jacobean play printing," we should then consider what makes
him such an outlier even among highly connected printers, and how
*Othello* figures in his uniquely expansive web of connections.
Traditional book history may offer some clues. As Blayney notes, "the
majority of Okes' books" were small pamphlets, news items, and ephemera
"of a kind which could have been expected to sell fairly well."[^45]
Entrepreneurial in the extreme, Okes sought out work that was timely and
could be turned around quickly in response to contemporary events and
market demands.

He also sought out clients like his connection John Budge - who was
himself one of the ten most connected booksellers during this period, an
early member of the Virginia Company, and the person charged with buying
books to supply the colonists in that company. Among the publications
that Okes printed for Budge and others we find many that clarify the LDA
topics associating Moorish identity in *Othello* with global (and
especially Dutch) trade and commodities. At almost exactly the same time
he printed *Othello,* for example, Okes also printed *An Answere to the
Hollanders Declaration Concerning the Occurrents of the East-India*
(1622), which shows up in the same cluster of "Moor" texts. This was
part of a flurry of corantos, or newsletters, that had been published to
detail a conflict with the Dutch over the Banda Islands, which were and
are known for nutmeg and other spices. *A Courant of Newes from the East
India* was published on 8 February 1622, relating the story of a Dutch
invasion of an English settlement, in which the Dutch "sacked our house,
took away all our goods, murthered three of our Chinese servants, bound
the rest (as well English as Chinesses) hand & foote...\[and\] tumbled
them down over the rockes like dogs."[^46] *A Second Courante of Newes
from the East India* was published on 28 February and contained a series
of letters detailing further Dutch atrocities, and asking \"Is this the
recompence of our love and bloud shewed unto you, and shed for you, to
keepe you from the supposed thraldome of *Spaine?*\"[^47] The Dutch
replied, claiming they held rights to all the Island's "Nutmegs and
Maces," and this led to Okes printing *An Answere to the Hollanders
Declaration.* The tract continues the he-said-she-said in a way that
strikingly parallels the action of *Othello* itself. The tract
scandalously claims that the master of the Dutch ship that first claimed
the island, "one Chirke," was \"a Cuckold before he was a Christian, for
being married in *Holland,* he left his wife with his familiar friends,
who did out of their familiar love encrease the family in the Husbands
absence.\"[^48] The tract continues to press the invalidity of the Dutch
claim by undermining its agent, stating "it was two or three years after
that Chircke was christned. Such Christians may quickly turne Moores who
delay Baptising 'till thirty five."[^49] The Dutch in this tract are the
true Others, brutally suppressing the English and natives. The cultural
ground on which this suppression plays out [---]{.emdash}  adultery and
cuckoldry, religious conversion and hypocrisy, murder and deception
[---]{.emdash}  would have been familiar to any early reader of
*Othello.*

The point, however, is not to argue that this Dutch dispute should
replace those readings of *Othello* that would situate it in terms of
Spanish-Catholic conflict or Ottoman aggression. Rather, the play
participates in a culture of global news, information, and
entertainment, and the slim, inexpensive 1622 Quarto (in contrast with
the substantial and costly 1623 Folio) especially must be read in a
context where its geographical and mercantile aspects resonated just as
strongly as its ethnographic and religious ones. In the Quarto, which
lacks the most inflammatory language of racial difference, much of the
drama of the opening scenes derives from the transmission of news
itself:

> Duke: There is no composition in these news
>
> That gives them credit.
>
> First Senator: Indeed, they are disproportioned.
>
> My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
>
> Duke: And mine a hundred-forty.
>
> Second Senator: And mine two hundred.
>
> But though they jump not on a just account [---]{.emdash}
>
> As, in these cases, where the aim reports
>
> 'Tis oft with difference [---]{.emdash}  yet do they all confirm
>
> A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. (I.iii.1-8)

This sort of ambiguity was a structural feature of early corantos,
Marcus Nevit has argued, as "the end of each issue willfully left its
customers unsatisfied, pitched uncertainly on the edge," and "skepticism
thus became a key weapon in the newsmongers' quest to secure a regular
paying audience."[^50]

In 1622, *Othello* became "the first Shakespeare play to be newly
published in more than a decade" in part because it participated in this
emerging news culture in an utterly timely way and because both its
printer and publisher were ambidextrous "connectors" bringing multiple
discourses into conversation for a quick profit.[^51] Okes and Walkley
may have recognized that this play about a "valiant Moor" was a vendible
commodity precisely for the thematic threads that our LDA models suggest
[---]{.emdash}  naval journeys, news of military conflicts, and
travelers' tales that include both exotic people such as "cannibals" and
objects of purely geographical fascination: "deserts idle, / Rough
quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven" (I.iii.47, 139-40).

While *Othello* is unusually "complex" in the way it weaves these
strands together, compared with other Shakespearean tragedies or with
plays by contemporaries, the cluster of King's Men plays published by
Oakes and/or Walkley from 1619 to 1622 share this investment in news and
global culture. *The Tragedy of Thierry and Theodoret* (1621) depicts a
court that is thrown into turmoil by "daily Libels, almost Ballads, / In
every place, almost in every Province" (I.i.63-4), and when the prince
is poisoned (with his mother's handkerchief!) doctors bring goods from
around the world to heal him, including "more cooling opium then would
kill a turke" (V.ii.12). The first Quarto of *Philaster* (1620)
published by Okes and Walkley (but not the second quarto and most modern
editions) begins with the question:

> Come gallants, what's the newes,
>
> the season affords us variety,
>
> the novilists of our time runnes on heapes,
>
> to glut their itching eares with airie sounds,
>
> trotting to'th burse; and in the Temple walke
>
> with greater zeale to heare a novall lye
>
> then a pyous Anthum tho chanted by Cherubins. (I.i.9-15)

*Othello* and these other plays surely appealed to Walkley and Okes for
a variety of reasons: works by Shakespeare and the King's Men were
popular and already had a certain literary prestige, as evidenced by the
capital intensive publication of the Folio in 1623, which was years in
the making. But that book's publishers, William Jaggard and his son
Isaac, were never as extensively connected through collaboration and
shared printing as Okes in our analysis of the early modern print
network because their operation was always more centralized and stable,
capable of taking the long view and cultivating literary legacies that
aspired very specifically to be "not for an age but for all time," as
Ben Jonson wrote in the First Folio. But in 1619-22, both our topic
modeling and our network analysis points to Othello's identity
[---]{.emdash}  as a soldier, as a global traveler, as part of an
exploration of the global geography and culture [---]{.emdash}  as part
of the play's appeal to a printer and publisher more reliant on
contemporary events.

 

**Conclusion** {#conclusion style="text-align: center;"}
--------------

At the moment of its initial print publication, *Othello* participated
in two distinct slices of the marketplace of books and of ideas about
race and globalism in the Renaissance. Pivoting between the topic
modeling of the full text data and the print networks of the metadata
shows us both how the geographical understanding of space shaped an
important strand of the discussion about race, and how the conversation
about Moors was mediated by the print networks responsible for the
production and dissemination of these ideas.

*Othello's* role in the English discourse of the Moor changed
dramatically after the publication of the Folio in 1623. Shakespeare's
text became a touchstone in the articulation of English's racial
imagination in the expansion of its colonial ambitions. It did not
simply reflect the racial attitudes of the seventeenth century but
assumed the role of a foundational text setting the very terms upon
which Englishmen could think and speak about England's place on an
increasingly global stage. Analysis of English texts in the Folio's
aftermath, shown in figure twenty two, shows that as the seventeenth
century progressed, topics invoking the actual editions of *Othello*
consistently participate in the discourse of "complexion" and geography,
with the models including the proper names "Othello," "Desdemona,"
"Iago," and "Shakespear," alongside the "Tartar" and the "Indian" and
places like "Florida," "Jordan," "Arabia," "Persia," "Ireland," and of
course, "Venice."

Figure 22. Topics Including or Mentioning Othello after 1623.
:::

What is remarkable in the texts composing these later Othello topics is
the extent to which the play's characters, who have little to do with
India or Tartary, are routinely plucked from the Mediterranean and
Venetian context so as to be used as a portable racial heuristic used to
demystify foreign geographies and cultures and to imagine a global
network of trade. For example, the 1672 *Two Broadsides Against
Tobacco,* containing King James' polemics about trade, rails against
tobacco and coffee as corrupting commodities, describing the
relationship of "coffee, a kind of Turkish Renegade" that is "joyn'd" in
a "match with Christian water." The extended anthropomorphism of this
unholy romance hinges on a climactic moment of violent frisson between
the two, as "sure he suspects, and shuns her as a Whore, / and loves,
and kills, like the Venetian Moor. / Bold Asian Brat!"[^52] These topics
demonstrate *Othello*'s viral quality in late seventeenth-century
conversations defining England's position in an increasingly dense
network of geographies, cultures, commodities, and colonies. This
reception of Shakespeare's dramatic text precisely matches the
conventional racialized understanding of Othello that we have inherited
through the First Folio.

Far from flattening the complexity of the literary field into a
two-dimensional matrix of numbers, we propose that the digital methods
employed here are useful for teasing out layers of latent historicity in
our reading strategies.[^53] Our results suggest that the focus on the
body as the measuring stick of racial ideologies  - sexual, anatomical,
religious, political, or otherwise - should be understood as an
invention of a colonialist worldview that did not exist in the same way
at the time of Shakespeare, Oakes, and Jaggard, but which did come to
define their later reception. Tracing the history of race in the early
modern era through influential texts like *Othello* opens up a critical
space to reanimate historically significant but unfamiliar models of
race that we have lost in the postcolonial world. From this new vantage
point, we may have the power to articulate alternative non-essentialist
vocabularies, using Shakespeare's global text to rethink the idea of
ethnic difference in today's globalized - and increasingly racialized -
society.
